# Two Hour Schmooze React app

This is a tool for my fantasy baseball league to help track keeper rules and other stuff. The tool will show a table of all keeper history and can be filtered by year, team or player.

# League Keeper Rules

Each team can keep up to 5 players at the beginning of a new season.

Players can keep players up to 3 times. Each time they are kept there is a different price increase based on the consecutive time they are being kept. Here is the scale:

1st time - $3 increase from previous year
2nd time - $5 increase from previous year
3rd time - $7 increase from previous year

If a player is traded, this resets. Or if a player is not kept.
